# remove the spaces
print("skdjf dkjfls sdfjsd dskfj".replace(' ', ''))

# remove the tabs
print("This is a tab here\t\tksdjfdjf".replace('\t', ''))

# NOTE: remove the tabs using a space as the first param. THIS DOES NOT WORK.  
print("This is a tab here\t\tksdjfdjf".replace(' ', ''))

# NOTE: I'm not going to make an example where I type 'tab' key,
# but then when the editor saves the tab, the tabs are replaced with spaces,
# because obviously, they are just spaces now. (I didn't just make that 
# mistake right now. LOL)
